/**
 * In this lab focus on CLASS Encapsulation and  the Single Responsibility 
 * Principle (SRP) and fix/add code as necessary.
 * 
 * Pay special attention to the following issues:
 *    1. It is not the job of this class or any of the methods in this class
 *       to do output. So you must remove the System.out.println statements.
 *       But we still need output. What to do? Delegate that work to a new
 *       object that IS responsible for output. Create a report service class
 *       and have the employee object talk to that object to perform the output.
 *       Using a separate class inside another like this is a form of class
 *       encapsulation -- hiding a class within another class.
 *       Notice how you can easily change the way output is done, going from
 *       console output to JOptionPane output if desired without the Employee
 *       object knowing about the change. Flexible!
 * 
 *    2. When doing method validation we have a similar problem. It is not the
 *       job of this class or any of its methods to do output. But error
 *       messages aren't a reporting issue. Error messages can be produced
 *       from invalid data in any program, whether or not those programs have
 *       reporting services. So we need a different approach. The right thing
 *       to do is to create an exception that notifies the user that a 
 *       validation error has happened. An example of this is provided in the
 *       setFirstName() method. Mimic this behavior in other setter methods.
 *       Note: a thorough discussion of Exceptions and how to use them is
 *       a future topic of this course. But those details are beyond the
 *       scope of this lesson.
 * 
 * Review the tips in the document "EncapCheckList.pdf" if needed.
