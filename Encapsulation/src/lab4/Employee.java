/**
 * As with the previous lab you should focus on CLASS Encapsulation and the 
 * Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). However what makes this lab DIFFERENT
 * is that in a real program you would need more than just an Employee class 
 * and a EmployeeResportService class. Remember what you learned about OOA/D and 
 * finding the Conceptual Objects in the Problem Domain.
 * 
 * Pay special attention to the following issues:
 *    1. You will need additional classes to simulate the real world. To keep
 *       things simple you should think about adding two more classes. Think
 *       about how employees are hired, who does the hiring and who do those
 *       people work for. Think about the Nouns used in business with respect
 *       to hiring employees and commanding them to go through orientation.
 * 
 *    2. When adding these classes think about the Single Responsibility 
 *       Principle and Class Encapsulation -- hiding classes inside other
 *       classes, similar to what you did with the report service which was
 *       hidden inside the Employee class.
 * 
 *    3. For those who struggle with this final lab a solution is provided.
 *       However, you should not look at the solution unless absolutely 
 *       necessary if you are stuck. Try to do as much of this lab on your 
 *       own by doing critical thinking about the classes you need and the 
 *       responsibilities you are giving each class.
 * 
 * Review the tips in the document "EncapCheckList.pdf" if needed.
